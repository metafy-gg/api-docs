description: An overview of using OAuth2 with Metafy
---

OAuth2 enables application developers to build applications that utilize authentication and data from the Metafy API. Within Metafy,
there are multiple types of OAuth2 authentication. We support the authorization code grant and client credentials.

## OAuth URLs

| URL | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| `https://metafy.gg/auth/authorize` | Authorize URL |
| `https://metafy.gg/irk/oauth/token` | Token URL |
| `https://metafy.gg/irk/oauth/revoke` | Token Revocation URL |

## Setting up OAuth

<Steps titleSize="h3">
  <Step title="Create your OAuth Application">
    Go to your [OAuth Applications](https://metafy.gg/account/settings/oauth) settings and create a new application.

    Retrieve your `client_id` and `client_secret` from the application settings.

    <Warning>Your client secret will only be shown once, so make sure to save it in a secure location.</Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Read the documentation">
    Familiarize yourself with the OAuth flow you want to use.
  </Step>
  <Step title="???">
    Let us know what you end up building!

## State and Security

Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) and Clickjacking attacks are common security vulnerabilities in web applications.
The `state` parameter is a security feature that helps prevent these attacks by adding a unique token to the OAuth2 flow.
When the user is redirected back to your application, you should verify that the `state` parameter matches the value you provided in the initial request.

While Metafy does not require the use of the `state` parameter, we recommend using it.

## Authorization Code Grant

The authorization code grant is what most developers will recognize as "standard" and involves retrieving an authorization code and exchanging it for an access token.
It allows the authorization server to act as an intermediary between the client and the resource owner, so the resource owner's credentials are never
exposed to the client.

### Authorization URL Example

```
https://metafy.gg/auth/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI&response_type=code&state=YOUR_STATE&scope=profile
```

`client_id` is your OAuth application's client id. `scope` is a list of scopes separated by url encoded spaces (`%20`). `redirect_uri` is the URL
you provided when creating your OAuth application, url-encoded. `state` is the unique string mentioned in [State and Security](#state-and-security).

When someone navigates to this URL, they will be prompted to authorize your application for the requested scoeps. On acceptance, they will be redirected to your
`redirect_uri`, which will contain an additional query parameter `code` that you can exchange for an access token. `state` will also be returned if you included
it in your original request and should be validated at this point.

### Redirect URL Example

```
https://example.com/oauth/callback?code=AUTHORIZATION_CODE&state=YOUR_STATE
```

`code` is now exchanged for the account's access token by making a `POST` request to the [token URL](#oauth-urls) with the following parameters:

- `grant_type` - must be set to `authorization_code`
- `code` - the authorization code provided to your redirect
- `redirect_uri` - The URL you provided when creating your OAuth application
- `client_id` - your oauth application's `client_id`
- `client_secret` - your oauth application's `client_secret`

### Access Token Exchange Example

<CodeGroup>
```javascript exchangeCode.js
const CLIENT_ID = "0JmpefPS2BvB-4Q6lfwly1Iff-sR5UWaklLoRrwEvO8"
const CLIENT_SECRET = "5b32600f350ed4def74dd0863847130fd007bb5abcec2f5447ca620b5ef526e9"

async function exchangeCode(code) {
  const response = await fetch("https://metafy.gg/irk/oauth/token", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      "client_id": CLIENT_ID,
      "client_secret": CLIENT_SECRET,
      "grant_type": "authorization_code",
      "redirect_uri": "https://example.com/oauth/callback"
      code,
    })
  });
  return response.json();
}
```
</CodeGroup>

### Access Token Response

```json
{
  "access_token": "RC5Gkg3z2HZpyhGwtuXjoVwzmLHup6WXBUXVfyrNkkc",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 7200,
  "refresh_token": "xrnkPBzIOguCT1Vu0uzqpKEvayH2iREwZdL4qRNQX6M",
  "scope": "profile",
  "created_at": 1741231327
}
```

Having the account's access token allows your application to make certain requests to the API on their behalf, restricted to whatever scopes were requested.
`expires_in` is how long, in seconds, until the returned access token expires, allowing you to anticipate the expiration and refresh the token. To refresh, make
another `POST` request to the [token URL](#oauth-urls) with the following parameters:

- `grant_type` - must be set to `refresh_token`
- `refresh_token` - the refresh token provided in the access token response
- `client_id` - your oauth application's `client_id`
- `client_secret` - your oauth application's `client_secret`

Once requested, you'll receive a fresh [access token response](#access-token-response).

### Token Revocation

To disable an access or refresh token, you can revoke it by making a `POST` request to the [token revocation URL](#oauth-urls) with the following parameters:

<Warning>
When you revoke a token, any active access or refresh tokens associated with that authorization will be revoked, regardless of the token and token_hint_type values you pass in.
</Warning>

- `token` - the access or refresh token to revoke
- `token_type_hint` _(optional)_ - set to `access_token` or `refresh_token`
- `client_id` - your oauth application's `client_id`
- `client_secret` - your oauth application's `client_secret`

## Client Credentials Grant

The client credentials flow is a quick and easy way for developers to get their own access tokens. By making a `POST` request to the [token URL](#oauth-urls) with
a grant type of `client_credentials`, you will be returned an access token for the application owner.

You can specify scopes with the `scope` parameter.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript clientCredentials.js
const CLIENT_ID = "0JmpefPS2BvB-4Q6lfwly1Iff-sR5UWaklLoRrwEvO8"
const CLIENT_SECRET = "5b32600f350ed4def74dd0863847130fd007bb5abcec2f5447ca620b5ef526e9"

async function exchangeCode(code) {
  const response = await fetch("https://metafy.gg/irk/oauth/token", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      "client_id": CLIENT_ID,
      "client_secret": CLIENT_SECRET,
      "grant_type": "client_credentials",
      "scope": "profile"
    })
  });
  return response.json();
}
```
</CodeGroup>

### Client Credentials Access Token Response

```json
{
  "access_token": "RC5Gkg3z2HZpyhGwtuXjoVwzmLHup6WXBUXVfyrNkkc",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 7200,
  "scope": "profile",
  "created_at": 1741231327
}
```

<Info>Notice, that you do not get a `refresh_token` when using the client credentials flow.</Info>
