API keys enable application developers to build applications that utilize authentication and data from the Metafy API for their own account.

<Warning>
Protect your API keys to prevent unauthorized access. API keys can be a security risk if they fall into the wrong hands.
</Warning>

## Setting up API Keys

<Steps titleSize="h3">
  <Step title="Create an API Key">
    To create an API key, navigate to the [API Keys](https://metafy.gg/account/settings/api-keys) section of your account settings.

    Click the "Create API Key" button and give your key a description. You can create multiple keys for different applications or services.
    API keys are scoped so make sure to include the scopes you need when creating a key.

    Once you've created your key, you'll be shown the key value. Make sure to copy this value and store it securely. You won't be able to see it again.

## Using API Keys

API keys are used to authenticate requests to the Metafy API. You can include your API key in the `Authorization` header of your requests like so:

```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

You can also include your API key as a query parameter in your requests:

```http
https://metafy.gg/irk/api/v1/me?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY
```
