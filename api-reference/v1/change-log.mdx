<Update label="March 2025">
## API Keys

We now support authentication via API keys. You can create and manage API keys in your Metafy [account settings](https://metafy.gg/account/settings/api-keys).
API keys are a great way to authenticate your requests without needing to handle OAuth tokens.

## Launched

The Metafy Dev site has launched and access to our API is now available. We're excited to see what you build with it!

The API is still being actively worked on. Reach out to us on Discord or GitHub if you need any functionality we don't currently support.
